## Abstract

Workflow Control is a local, single-user workflow engine for running
AI coding agents on tasks too large for one CLI session. It exists in
the gap between **Claude Code** (which is excellent for one-shot
coding turns but loses state when a task takes hours) and
**Temporal/Airflow** (which are excellent at orchestrating
deterministic services but were never designed for LLM agents that
need feedback loops, hot-update of in-flight prompts, and human
approval gates mid-task).

The product's two non-negotiable invariants:

1. **Reproducibility under interruption.** A task that ran for 75
   minutes across 20 stages must survive `pkill node`, `tsx watch`
   restarting on a file edit, the user closing their laptop, the
   server crashing — without losing the work that already finished.
2. **Hot-updateable in flight.** When the user notices their pipeline
   is wrong at stage 17 of 25, they must be able to fix the prompt or
   add a verification stage *without restarting the task* and without
   losing the 16 completed stages.

This document explains *what* the system does, *why* its design
choices look the way they do, and *how* the kernel actually
implements both invariants.

---

## Part 1 — What

### 1.1 The product, in one paragraph

The user describes a multi-step AI task in natural language. An
internal `pipeline-generator` (itself a workflow) emits a typed
**Pipeline IR** with stages, ports, wires, and gates. The user (or
an automated runner) starts a **Task** against that Pipeline IR. The
kernel drives the task through its stages — running Claude SDK
sessions for `agent` stages, in-process scripts for `script` stages,
fanout loops for `fanout` stages, human-blocking gates for `gate`
stages — recording every attempt, every port write, every cost dollar
to a SQLite database. A web dashboard shows progress live; a CLI/MCP
surface lets other Claude instances drive the same kernel.

If the kernel restarts mid-task, **boot resumability** picks the task
up from its last persisted state. If the user wants to change the
pipeline mid-task, **hot-update** lets a `pipeline-modifier` propose
a patch, the user approves it, the kernel migrates the running task
to the new IR, and only the affected stages re-run.

### 1.2 What it is *not*

The roadmap is explicit about non-goals (CLAUDE.md "What this project
is not"):

| Not | Why |
|---|---|
| A multi-tenant SaaS | One user per server process. No auth. No tenant isolation. |
| A team scheduling / approval platform | Human gates exist for the individual user, not for cross-team review. |
| A general-purpose orchestrator | The DSL, executor model, and audit log are AI-agent-specific. Don't run cron jobs through it. |
| A Claude Code wrapper | The workflow engine is the product. Claude Code is one of several execution surfaces. |
| Multi-engine | As of 2026-04-24 only Claude is supported. Gemini/Codex were retired. |

These non-goals are **load-bearing**: they let the design ignore
authentication, network partitioning, multi-version DB migrations
across user fleets, and most operational complexity that
general-purpose orchestrators cannot avoid.

**Execution is single-user.** Every Task runs against one user's
local SQLite + filesystem; there is no cross-user state of any
kind. Cross-user *sharing* is supported via file-based export /
import: every pipeline detail page exposes an **Export** button that
downloads a `wfctl-pipeline-export/v1` JSON envelope
(`{ format, exportedAt, source, ir, prompts }`); the pipelines list
page exposes **Import** to upload such a file. Imports route through
the same `KernelService.submit` validator stack as `submit_pipeline`,
so a hand-edited file cannot bypass validation. Secrets stay on each
machine (env vars or `run_pipeline`'s `envValues`); files contain
`envKey` *names* but never values. The earlier YAML-based public
registry was retired 2026-05-04 — its schema had diverged from
kernel-next's canonical IR, leaving installed packages unrunnable.

### 1.3 Surfaces

The same kernel is reachable from three independent surfaces:

| Surface | Used for |
|---|---|
| **HTTP REST + SSE** at `:3001` | Web dashboard, dogfood scripts, curl |
| **MCP over HTTP** at `:3001/api/mcp` | External Claude Code sessions, Cursor, Codex CLI |
| **CLI** (`pnpm --filter server prune-records`) | DB cleanup |

All three call into the same `KernelService` + same SQLite database.
There's no separate "API tier" — surfaces are thin adapters over the
service layer.

### 1.4 Forge — turning sessions into pipelines

The system above answers "I want to run a pipeline." But how does a
user *find* the pipeline they should run, or *notice* that a piece of
work they keep doing manually deserves to be automated?

**Forge** is the user-triggered loop that closes that gap. The
trigger lives in two places: the web `/forge` page (one button:
**Forge Now**), or the **`forge_analyze` MCP tool** that the user can
invoke from inside the Claude Code session itself — same backend,
no context switch. Forge:

1. Reads the session JSONL into its own `forge.db` (idempotent —
   re-runs are cheap; redaction at the boundary).
2. Runs the `forge-distill` builtin pipeline (one Claude agent stage)
   that summarizes the session into **episodes** — intent + abstracted
   steps + outcome + a `pipeline_able` verdict. **A typical session
   yields 3–7 episodes**, not one. The user almost always did multiple
   distinct things in a single session (fixed a bug, added a test,
   wrote a doc) — Forge surfaces every one that's pipeline-worthy.
3. Embeds each pipeline-able episode (batch call; default: a fully
   local hash-based embedder; Voyage / OpenAI optional via env keys).
4. For each episode, matches against an embedding-cached descriptor
   of every existing pipeline (refreshed lazily on first sight of
   each `version_hash`).
5. Per-episode branches:
   - **cosine ≥ 0.78** → "use existing pipeline X" with a one-click
     link.
   - **otherwise** → "create new" with a ready-to-paste prompt for
     `pipeline-generator` plus suggested external inputs already
     abstracted to the right shape.
6. Returns a single response with `recommendations: PerEpisodeRec[]`
   (sorted: matches first, then create-new) plus `skippedEpisodes`
   for the one-off / exploratory work the distiller marked as not
   pipeline-able. The user sees every automation candidate, not just
   one.

Forge is **request-scoped**, not a daemon. The user is in the loop on
every analysis. The `forge.db` schema also tracks cross-session
clusters as informational signal ("you've done this 3 times across 2
days") but does NOT gate the recommendation — the user's click is the
trigger.

Surfaces: web `/forge` page + HTTP `POST /api/forge/analyze` /
`GET /api/forge/sessions` etc. + MCP tool `forge_analyze` exposed via
`/api/mcp`. forge.db is local-only and is *not* serialized into the
1.28 export envelope; sharing remains pipeline-level.

## Part 2 — Why

### 2.1 Why a kernel at all?

Three real problems pushed this product out of the "just use Claude
Code" sweet spot:

#### Problem 1: Long tasks lose state

A real investigation task — "research ESM/CommonJS interop in Node 22
TypeScript monorepos and write a 10,000-word report" — ran for 75
minutes across 20 stages including 3 fanout loops with 30+ Claude
sessions total. In a Claude Code REPL the user has to:

- Manually keep track of which sub-task is in progress
- Re-prompt with the right context if Claude's session compacts
- Lose everything if their laptop sleeps or `tsc watch` restarts

A kernel that **owns the state** rather than holding it in a chat
buffer makes the task survive restarts. Every stage's output is
persisted to `port_values` keyed by `attempt_id`; resume queries the
DB, not memory.

#### Problem 2: Pipelines are wrong on first try

When Claude generates a pipeline for a novel investigation topic, the
first version is rarely correct. The user notices at stage 17 that
the framing axis was off, or that a verification step is missing, or
that the synthesis prompt is too generic. In a stateless system the
fix means starting over — losing the 16 stages of expensive work.

A kernel that supports **structured hot-update** (propose a patch,
review the diff, migrate running tasks) lets the user fix forward.
The roadmap (B-series, §7) is dedicated to this: B9 worktree reset,
B10 graceful summary turn, B17 fanout element preservation, etc. The
hot-update path **is** the product, not a feature.

#### Problem 3: One Claude session is too small

Even with cache, a single SDK conversation has a context budget.
Multi-stage pipelines split work into segments small enough for the
SDK to handle while preserving cross-segment state through `port_values`
+ optional `single-session` mode (which lets adjacent stages share a
session via SDK `options.resume`).

### 2.2 Why these specific design choices?

| Decision | Alternative considered | Why this won |
|---|---|---|
| **IR is canonical, not YAML** | YAML stays canonical | YAML changes in whitespace/key-order shouldn't shift `version_hash`; canonical IR + `pipelineVersionHash({ir, prompts})` solves it. (terminal-design §2) |
| **AI writes the IR, never the human** | Hand-written DSL | An expert pipeline author is rare. Pipeline-generator is itself a workflow; users describe the task in NL and get a validated IR. (CLAUDE.md "Who writes the YAML") |
| **kernel-next + XState v5** | Bespoke event loop | XState's parallel-region semantics map 1-1 onto independent stages; INTERRUPT propagation, retry-rebuild, gate-rejection are all native state-machine operations rather than ad-hoc flags. |
| **Lineage-preserve, not delete-and-rewrite** | Reset rows on retry | An attempt that ran 25 seconds is real work. Across retries / hot-updates / rollbacks every prior `success` row stays intact (only `superseded` flag flips during migration, never on reject-rollback). Auditing 6 months later is possible. |
| **SQLite, not Postgres/SQS** | Server DB | Single-user. SQLite handles 2400 tests in 55s + every concurrent runtime path. WAL gives us durability on power loss. No ops cost. |
| **Claude only** | Multi-engine | Each engine had its own sub-bugs; cross-engine semantic divergence dwarfed the gain. Retired in Stage 4a. |

### 2.3 Why is reject-rollback not a delete?

Subtle but defining: when a user rejects a gate, the targeted
upstream stages re-run, but their old `stage_attempts` rows stay at
`status='success'`. New runs add `attempt_idx=2,3,...`. **Lineage is
the union, not a replacement.** This is the same invariant that
makes hot-update auditable — old version's work is *evidence*, not
garbage.

Only **migration** uses `status='superseded'` (B17), because
migration explicitly means "this attempt was on a now-defunct
pipeline version". Reject-rollback isn't migration; it's "the
content was wrong, but the attempt happened".

This was contested for several dogfood iterations and is documented
in `handoff-dogfood-bug16.md` § "Lineage preservation is the design
choice".

### 3.2 The IR — what a Pipeline really is

A `PipelineIR` is a JSON document validated by `ir/schema.ts`
(zod). The shape:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-investigation",
  "externalInputs": [
    { "name": "topic", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "topicFraming",
      "type": "agent",                       // or "script" | "gate"
      "inputs":  [{ "name": "topic", "type": "string" }],
      "outputs": [{ "name": "axes", "type": "string[]" }],
      "config": { "promptRef": "topicFraming", "model": "claude-..." }
    },
    {
      "name": "framingGate",
      "type": "gate",
      "inputs":  [{ "name": "axes", "type": "string[]" }],
      "outputs": [],                         // gate's __gate_feedback__ is implicit
      "config": {
        "question": { "text": "Approve framing?", "options": [
          { "value": "approve" }, { "value": "reject" }
        ] },
        "routing":  { "routes": { "approve": "tutorialAuthoring",
                                  "reject":  "topicFraming" } }
      }
    }
    // ...
  ],
  "wires": [
    { "from": { "source": "external", "port": "topic" },
      "to":   { "stage": "topicFraming", "port": "topic" } },
    { "from": { "source": "stage", "stage": "topicFraming", "port": "axes" },
      "to":   { "stage": "framingGate", "port": "axes" } }
  ]
}
```

Three things to note:

1. **Wires, not implicit shared state.** Stages don't reach into a
   shared blackboard; every cross-stage data flow is a typed wire
   from a producer's output port to a consumer's input port.
   `wireDelivers` checks both source presence (`wireSettled`) and
   any conditional guard before considering a wire deliverable.
2. **Gate routes can be multi-target.** `reject: ["A", "B"]` means
   rejecting this gate rolls back stages A and B *together*, plus
   the gate itself, plus everything downstream of the gate-feedback
   wire. Validated by `validator/structural.ts` to ensure all
   targets are ancestors (rollback semantics).
3. **`version_hash` includes prompts.** Two pipelines that differ
   only in prompt content produce different versions. This is what
   lets `propose_pipeline_change(prompts: { foo: "new content" })`
   produce a meaningfully-new `proposedVersion` even when ops are
   empty.

### 3.3 IR → XState compilation

`compiler/ir-to-machine.ts:compileIRToMachine` takes the IR and
emits an XState `createMachine(...)` call. Each stage becomes a
**parallel region** with sub-states `idle | waiting | executing | done | error`. Wires
become guards on the `waiting → executing` transition: a stage
enters `executing` only when **all its inbound wires are settled
+ deliverable**.

```
                 ┌─────┐
                 │idle │  (only at machine startup)
                 └──┬──┘
                    │ always (entry guard)
                    ▼
              ┌──────────┐
              │ waiting  │
              └──┬───┬───┘
                 │   │  always: all inbound wireDelivers
                 │   │  AND (gate-routed → authorized)
                 │   ▼
                 │  ┌────────────┐
                 │  │ executing  │
                 │  └──┬─────────┘
                 │     │ PORT_WRITTEN: all outputs present
                 │     ▼
                 │  ┌──────┐
                 │  │ done │  (final)
                 │  └──────┘
                 │
                 │ STAGE_FAILED: stage matches
                 ▼
              ┌──────┐
              │error │  (final)
              └──────┘
```

The root machine has handlers for cross-cutting events:
- `PORT_WRITTEN { key, value }` → updates `context.portValues`,
  re-evaluates every region's guards.
- `GATE_ANSWERED { gateId, stageName, answer, targetStage }` →
  routes to the gate's region, transitions to `done`,
  conditionally adds `targetStage(s)` to `gateAuthorizedTargets`.
- `GATE_REJECTED` → intercepted by `dispatcher.send` (not the actor
  directly) so the runner can build a "rollback" verdict, prune
  affected stages from `persistentPortValues`, and rebuild the
  actor on the next attempt iteration.
- `INTERRUPT { stage? }` → forwarded to the stage's invoke child;
  if `stage` is undefined, broadcast to every executing region;
  fanout stages additionally abort via a parallel `fanoutInterruptController`
  (Bug 81 fix, dogfood-13).

### 3.4 The Runner loop

`runtime/runner.ts:runPipeline` is the outer driver:

```pseudo
loop {
  verdict = await runOneAttempt()
  switch verdict {
    case "natural":   break             // pipeline reached its sink stages
    case "retry":     prune ports for backToStage's downstream
                      bump retryCounts[stage]
                      continue           // rebuild actor
    case "rollback":  drop persistentPortValues for affectedStages
                      seed gate-feedback "" for each affected gate
                      record rejectFromGates[fromGate]
                      continue           // rebuild actor
    case "interrupted": break            // INTERRUPT delivered externally
  }
}
record task_finals
unregister from taskRegistry
delete task_env_values  (P3.6 contract)
```

The trick is `runOneAttempt` does NOT just `await actor.start()` — it
installs an inspector that watches every snapshot for retry / reject
verdicts, AND maintains a separate executor-promises array for
fanout stages that live outside the actor lifecycle. When any of
these three signals arrives, the verdict is built explicitly and the
outer loop performs the correct rebuild.

### 3.5 Hot-update — the migration story

A concrete trace of `propose → approve → migrate → rollback`:

1. **Propose.** `KernelService.propose({ currentVersion, patch, prompts, rerunFrom, autoApprove })`:
   - Validates the patch against `currentVersion`'s IR (`ir/patch.ts:applyPatch`).
   - Computes the proposed `version_hash` from canonical (IR + prompts).
   - Inserts row in `pipeline_proposals` with `status='pending'` (or
     `'approved'` if autoApprove + verdict=`safe`).
   - Returns `{ proposalId, proposedVersion, diff, impact, safeRange }`.
2. **Approve.** (auto-approved is in-line; manual is separate
   `approveProposal` call.)
3. **Migrate.** `migrateTask(taskId, proposalId)` →
   `executeMigration` in `hot-update/migration-orchestrator.ts`:
   - Acquires per-task lock (`MIGRATION_IN_PROGRESS` if held).
   - Sends `INTERRUPT` to live runner if **any non-gate stage is
     running** (Bug 80 fix, dogfood-10: skip when only gates are
     running, since gate.executing has no INTERRUPT handler).
   - Computes `supersedeSet = computeWireTransitiveReaders(ir, rerunFrom)` —
     every stage reachable via wires from the rerun point.
   - Snapshots pre-supersede status for reverse.
   - In one transaction: marks affected `stage_attempts` as
     `superseded` (preserving `kind='fanout_element' AND status='success'` —
     B17), closes any open `gate_queue` rows targeting superseded
     attempts.
   - Optionally `git reset --hard before_sha` in the task's
     worktree (B9 full).
   - Calls `startPipelineRun({ resumeFrom: rerunFrom })` to launch a
     new runner against the new version.
   - On any startRunner failure → reverse-supersede (restore status
     from snapshot) + audit `failed/RESUME_FAILED`.
4. **Rollback.** A user who regrets the migrate calls
   `rollbackHotUpdate({ taskId, toVersion })`:
   - Computes the inverse patch (forward patch's reversal).
   - Re-runs the migrate flow against `toVersion` as the new target.
   - Audited as a fresh `hot_update_events` row with `kind='rollback'`.

### 3.6 Resumability invariants

What restart looks like:

```
SIGTERM ───► graceful-shutdown.reconcileRunningAttempts:
              UPDATE stage_attempts SET status='superseded'
                WHERE status='running'
              UPDATE gate_queue ...
              writeTaskFinals(...) for each interrupted task
                with reason='interrupted'
            taskRegistry.interruptAll(deadline)
            await all runners terminate or timeout

(server shut down, restarts later)

server boot ─► bootResumability:
              for each task NOT in task_finals:
                resolve last live state from stage_attempts
                if any stage is in 'running' → it's an orphan;
                  classifyOrphan() decides whether to
                  re-launch (resume) or finalise (failed)
                if pipeline is mid-fanout → preserve fanout_element
                  successes (B17), kick off only the missing indices
              startPipelineRun({ resumeFrom: <recovered point> })
```

Three crucial invariants this preserves:

1. **No double-spend on Anthropic.** A stage that already wrote its
   port values does not re-run; the resumed runner finds it in
   `stage_attempts.status='success'` and short-circuits the region
   to `done`.
2. **Reject-rollback survives restart.** The `gate_feedback` port
   is persisted; on resume, the rebuilt machine sees the same
   feedback that prompted the upstream rerun. (Bug 16 — dogfood-5/6
   — fixed exactly this seam.)
3. **Fanout partial state survives.** 14 of 16 elements done, restart, only
   the 2 missing/superseded elements re-run. (B17 / handoff-dogfood-2026-05-02
   Bug 15 covers the migration variant.)

## Part 4 — The visible product

### 4.1 Web UI surface map

```
/                               ← Launch hub: all pipelines + run dialog
/kernel-next                    ← Task list
/kernel-next/[taskId]           ← Live task detail (SSE, gates, attempts, audit, DAG)
/kernel-next/pipelines          ← Pipeline browser
/kernel-next/pipelines/[name]   ← Pipeline IR viewer + version history
/kernel-next/proposals          ← Hot-update proposals (approve / reject / migrate)
/kernel-next/attempts/[id]      ← Per-attempt deep-dive (lineage, diff, sidecar)
/kernel-next/mcp-catalog        ← MCP server inventory (encrypted secrets)
```

### 4.2 The MCP surface

External Claude sessions reach the kernel through MCP tools. The
external surface exposes **34 tools** (extracted via `tools/list` on
`/api/mcp`), grouped by domain. One additional tool (`write_port`)
is runner-internal only and never reaches external surfaces:

**Pipeline authoring & execution**
```
  submit_pipeline(ir, prompts)            — register a new IR
  validate_pipeline(ir)                   — dry-run validation, no persist
  describe_pipeline({ taskId | versionHash }) — IR + prompts for a version
  get_pipeline_definition(name)           — fetch from registry / fs
  run_pipeline({ name | versionHash, ... }) — start a task
  start_pipeline_generator(taskDescription) — convenience launch
  wait_pipeline_result(taskId, ...)       — block until terminal
```

**Task control & observation**
```
  get_task_status(taskId)                 — full state snapshot
  cancel_task(taskId, reason?)            — INTERRUPT + finalise
  retry_task(taskId, fromStage?)          — retry from earliest failure
  wait_for_task_event(taskId, predicate)  — async event-based wait
  list_gates(taskId?)                     — open / answered gates
  answer_gate(gateId, answer, comment?)   — answer a human gate
  provide_task_secrets(taskId, secrets, persistAs?) — unblock secret_pending
```

**Hot-update**
```
  propose_pipeline_change(...)            — emit a proposal
  dry_run_proposal(...)                   — see diff/impact without committing
  list_proposals(status?)                 — pending / approved / rejected
  approve_proposal(proposalId)
  reject_proposal(proposalId, reason?)
  migrate_task(taskId, proposalId)        — apply a proposal to a running task
  rollback_hot_update(taskId, toVersion)  — undo a successful migration
  update_registry_pipeline(...)           — bump a registered pipeline version
  query_hot_update_stats(...)             — Stage 5E aggregates
```

**Lineage & debug**
```
  read_port(taskId, stage, port)          — read latest port_value
  query_lineage(taskId, ...)              — full audit / explain trail
  diff_runs(taskA, taskB)                 — side-by-side diff
  compare_runs(...)                       — multi-axis comparison
  replay_stage(taskId, stage)             — re-execute one stage in isolation
  dry_run_stage(...)                      — try a stage with synthetic inputs
  propose_pipeline_fix(taskId, failedStage) — failure-driven modifier shortcut
```

**Registry / catalog**
```
  recommend_mcp_servers(query)            — Phase-1 supply-chain helper
  get_mcp_catalog_entry(serverName)       — manifest by name
  add_mcp_catalog_entry(entry)            — local catalog mutation
```

**Admin**
```
  prune_records({ taskId | olderThan })   — DB cleanup
```

**Runner-internal (NOT on external surface)**
```
  write_port(attemptId, port, value)      — kernel writes outputs
                                            via PortRuntime
```

Every tool returns a `{ ok: true, ... } | { ok: false, diagnostics: [...] }`
shape with structured codes — the same envelope used by the REST API.

The split between external (34) and internal (1) is enforced in
`kernel-next/mcp/server.ts`'s `createKernelMcp({ surface })` —
`surface: "external"` is the default for HTTP `/api/mcp`, while the
kernel's own runner spins up a combined-surface server per agent
attempt to expose `write_port`.

### 4.3 Key DB tables (annotated)

20 application tables in `kernel-next.db`. Grouped by purpose:

**Pipeline definition (content-addressed)**

| Table | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_versions` | `(version_hash, pipeline_name, ir_json, ts_source, parent_hash, created_at)` — every IR ever submitted |
| `stages` | Normalised mirror of `ir_json.stages` — one row per (version_hash, stage_name); used by lineage queries that join without parsing JSON |
| `ports` | Normalised mirror of stage inputs/outputs — one row per (version_hash, stage_name, port_name, direction) |
| `wires` | Normalised mirror of `ir_json.wires` — one row per wire so reverse-lookup ("who reads X?") is O(index) |
| `prompt_contents` | Content-addressed prompt body store (one row per distinct content_hash) |
| `pipeline_prompt_refs` | (version_hash, promptRef) → content_hash mapping |
| `pipeline_proposals` | `(proposal_id, status, base_version, proposed_version, patch_json, ...)` |

**Task runtime state**

| Table | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `stage_attempts` | One row per attempt: `(attempt_id, task_id, version_hash, stage_name, attempt_idx, status, kind, fanout_element_idx, started_at, ended_at)` |
| `port_values` | Lineage rows: `(value_id, attempt_id, stage_name, port_name, direction, value_json, written_at)` |
| `gate_queue` | One row per gate-stage entry: `(gate_id, task_id, attempt_id, question_json, answer, answered_at)` |
| `secret_gate_queue` | Per-task secret-pending state: `(secret_gate_id, task_id, stage_name, required_keys, resolved_at)` |
| `task_finals` | Terminal state: `(task_id, version_hash, final_state, reason, detail, ended_at)` |
| `task_worktrees` | Worktree ownership: `(task_id, workdir, status, allocated_at)` |
| `task_env_values` | Plaintext env values; auto-deleted when task ends (P3.6) |
| `stage_checkpoints` | Pre-stage git SHA for B9 reset target |

**Per-attempt sidecar data**

| Table | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `agent_execution_details` | Per-agent-attempt token usage, cost, compact events, cache stats |
| `script_execution_details` | Per-script-attempt termination reason, error, runtime |

**Hot-update audit + advisory**

| Table | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `hot_update_events` | Audit: `(event_id, task_id, from_version, to_version, status, started_at, finished_at, diagnostic_json)` |
| `migration_hints` | Advisory diff payload for hot-update successor attempts (B9-A) |

**Cross-task caches & supply-chain**

| Table | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `tutorial_cache` | Cross-task tutorial memo (D1): keyed by (subject_domain, slug); pipelines like web3-tech-research read it before regenerating expensive tutorials |
| `mcp_servers` + `mcp_secrets` | MCP catalog with encrypted-at-rest secrets |

Full schema: `apps/server/src/kernel-next/ir/sql.ts` (~600 lines including
indexes + the schema-evolution clean-slate migration logic). The
`stages`/`ports`/`wires` mirror tables are populated atomically with
each `pipeline_versions` insert via the same transaction.

## Part 5 — The visible test surface

The product is **defined by its tests** as much as by its code.
~1,955 server tests + 66 web tests cover the contracts the user
actually depends on:

| Suite | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `runner.test.ts` | Stage-region transitions, retry, gate-routed authorization |
| `runner.reject-rollback.test.ts` | Single-target + multi-target rollback (Bug 28) |
| `runner.cross-region-cancel.test.ts` | STAGE_CANCELLED propagation |
| `runner-fanout.*.test.ts` | Concurrency, retry, timeout, secret-pending, INTERRUPT (Bug 81) |
| `migration-orchestrator.test.ts` | INTERRUPT timeout, idle-at-gate skip (Bug 80), reverse-supersede, B13 sibling preservation |
| `real-executor.test.ts` | Claude SDK adapter, abort, rate-limit, cancel, resume, MCP status |
| `validator/*.test.ts` | Type compat, store schema, structural rules |
| `compiler/ir-to-machine.test.ts` | IR → machine compile, multi-target rollback compile |
| `kernel.test.ts` (KernelService) | submit, propose, approve, migrate, rollback, cancel, answer, provide_secrets |

Every commit that lands a fix lands a regression test. The dogfood
chain (handoffs `dogfood-2026-04-28/handoff-final.md` →
`handoff-dogfood-11-12-13.md`) walks every observable user path
end-to-end with real LLM calls.

---

## Part 6 — Honest limitations

1. **Local-only**. There is no auth, no remote multi-user, no audit
   chain across users. If you want a team workflow tool, this isn't it.
2. **Claude SDK dependency**. We're as good as Anthropic's SDK is
   stable. Outages, rate limits, breaking SDK changes are felt
   directly. We've shipped fixes for SDK status detection (Bug 11),
   compact event accounting (Phase 4.5 T1), and stderr noise filter,
   but a hostile SDK regression breaks this product.
3. **No prompt cache strategy yet**. Prompt caching works at the SDK
   layer (1.18-1.19 modifications observed 60-91% cache hit rates on
   real pipelines), but we don't *plan around* it — there's no
   "single-session decision gate" that uses cache stats to choose
   between segment shapes.
4. **Hand-writing IR is supported but inconvenient**. Two of the
   dogfood-13 era pipelines (multi-target rollback in dogfood-11
   and the fanout pipeline in dogfood-12) were hand-authored via
   `submit_pipeline` over MCP and ran end-to-end without issues —
   so the contract isn't broken. But the validator is strict about
   port-type strings, wire shapes, and gate-routing target
   ancestor-relationships, and a human typing IR will hit those
   guardrails repeatedly. The pipeline-generator path exists
   precisely so a human only has to describe the task in NL; the
   prompts that drive it are themselves much of the product's
   value, and we recommend that path for any non-trivial pipeline.
